## Description

This project is a challenge for a position.

## Assumptions and handling directional details and ambiguity

To deliver all the functionality fully functioning with top level UI in 2 to 3 hours was not possible, so I focused on building with the info that was available and more reliable, mostly the design.

The search component by itself, could be a project on its own with search algorithms, debouncing, accessibility, etc, so I build a dumb component with only the UI and basic interation to help navigate other features.
Applied same logic for the Tab component and buttons.

I assumed the request button on the main page is related to requesting a new asset, and not permission.

I could not match all icons perfectly, but that would be easily fixed with the actual design in hands, so I assumed it was not a problem and used google material icons.

I also mocked data directly on the code, as I assumed this delivery is more close to a middle-development stage, than a fully functional feature, as that would not be possible in the time frame.

## Improvements Made

- Added margin to the sides of the page, to make it fit better on wide screens.
- Added 'Asset' to the request button
- Removed margin from the items section
- Added mobile responsiveness

## How I would proceed on this project

- Get in touch with designers, PO, and clients ASAP to aquire a better understanding of the project and how the other tabs would work and look like, so I can better plan and code for the future, avoiding unnecessary work and refactor.
- Integrate with the API, get actual itens and assets data
- Remove mock data and make the necessary updates on the components on the main page and on the layout modal
- Finish the search input using the data from the API
- Add functionality to the buttons
- Finish the Tab component
- Use the existing components to build the other modals
- Add a request permission form to the request permission button
